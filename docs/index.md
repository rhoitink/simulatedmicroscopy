# Simulated Microscopy documentation

**Simulated Microscopy** is a small python package to create a point source image from a set of 3D coordinates and do subsequent convolution and noisification of that image to emulate the confocal microscopy imaging process.

The source can be found at [https://github.com/rhoitink/simulatedmicroscopy](https://github.com/rhoitink/simulatedmicroscopy).

Have a look at [how to install](installation.md) or [how to use](example-usage.md) this package.
